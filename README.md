Installer for [Mecha](https://github.com/mecha-cms/mecha)
=========================================================

Download the installer file then put the `start.php` file at the root of your siteâ€™s public folder. A public folder is
a special folder on your web server that serves to display files to the public face of your web site. Typically, this
folder will be named `htdocs`, `http`, `public_html` or `www`, depending on the policies and style of the web hosting
provider you use. Please consult your web server service provider about where you can access the web-based file manager
on your web server.

This is what it will look like if you have successfully uploaded the `start.php` file into the folder:

Next, you just need to visit the address http://your-site-domain.tld/start.php to begin the installation.
